//Getting Started with C# 10 and .NET 6
//Module Introduction
/*
    - Learning C# is a great choice!
    - C# is part of .NET

    .NET 
        - developer platform
        - open source
    
    What can you do with .NET?
        - Desktop
        - Mobile
        - Web
        - Cloud
        - Gaming
        - Artificial Intelligence

    The .NET Ecosystem
        - Language
            - C# 10
            - Visual Basic
            - F#
        - Libraries
        - Tools

    .NET 6 = .NET 5 + .NET Core 3.1
        - Cross-plaform
    
    Example
        Bethany's Pie Shop HR
            - HR Management software
    
    This version was created by using:
        - C# 10
        - .NET 6
        - Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

    This course is 100% applicable to:
        - C# 10 and C# 11
        - .NET 6 and .NET 7
        - Visual Studio 2022 (any edition)
    Most code will work fine with older versions of C#

    CLI = Command Line Interface

// Hello C#
/*
    C# 
    - is Main language for .NET development
    - Object-oriented and type-safe programming language
        Object-oriented programming = is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, ranther than functions and logic.  
            - Objects are the building blocks of C#
        Object = can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

    - Familiar for C, C++, Java and JS

//Setting up Your Environment
/*
    Building .NET Applications with C#
        - Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition
        - .NET CLI & Visual Studio Code
            CLI = Command Line Interface
    
    Introducing Visual Studio 2022
        Flagship IDE - Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

//Building Your First C# Program Using Visual Studio
/*
    Using Projects
        - Project = a collection of files that are related to each other
                - Containers for code files
                - Compiled into executable files (assembly)
                - Different templates

//Demo: Writing C# Code
/*
    - Writing C# code
    - Fixing a syntax error

    IntelliSence = is a code-completion tool that is built into the Visual Studio IDE. It is designed to help developers write code faster and with fewer errors by providing code completion, parameter info, and member lists based on context.
    IntelliQuote = is a feature of the Visual Studio IDE that automatically inserts closing quotation marks, parentheses, brackets, and braces. It is designed to help developers write code faster and with fewer errors.

//Demo: Exploring the Files in a C# Appplication
/*
    - Looking at the generated files
         - Project
         - Solution
         - Executable file
    - Executing our compiled application
*/

//Debugging Our Code
/*
    Introducing Breakpoints
        - Breakpoints = are used to pause the execution of a program at a specific line of code. They are used to debug code.
              - Pause the running code
              - Inspect the state of the running application
              - Step through the different lines of code
*/

//Building Applications Using the CLI
/*
    - .NET CLI

    Understanding the CLI
        - CLI = Command Line Interface for .NET
        - Cross-platform tools
        - "dotnet" command with parameters
    SDK = Software Development Kit

    Creating a New Project
        - dotnet new console -n "FirstProgram"
    
    - dotnet new = Create a new project
    - dotnet build = Compile your application
    - dotnet run = Execute your application
*/

//Demo: Building a C# Application Using the CLI
/*
    - Installing the required tools
    - Creating an application using the CLI
    - Editing code with VS Code
    - Compiling using the CLI
    - Running with VS Code and the CLI

    dotnet new 
    dotnet new console -n "HelloWorldFromCLI"
        - go to the folder
    dotnet build
    dotnet run

    The choice is yours!
    No matter what platform, you can write C# applications!

//Summary
/*
    - C# is an object-oriented and type-safe language to write .NET applications
    - C# is actively maintained
    - C# can be used to build all types of .NET applications
    - Applications can be created using
        - Visual Studio
